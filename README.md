# Designing Convolutional Neural Networks using Surrogate assisted Genetic Algorithm for Medical Image Classification
This is the companion repository for our paper titled "Designing Convolutional Neural Networks using Surrogate assisted Genetic Algorithm for Medical Image Classification". This paper has been accepted at the [The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion]([https://gecco-2023.sigevo.org/HomePage]).

## Data 
The data used in this project comes from the [MEDMNIST(http://medmnist.com)  and CIFAR-10 dataset]

## Requirements

The code runs using Python 3.9. You will need to install the packages present in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

### Run the experiments

To simply run all the experiments, you can type:

``python3 main.py run_all``
